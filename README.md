## SQL PRACTICE!!!!

### TO SET UP:

- Create a database (maybe `movies_dev` would be a good name)
- Run `psql -d [name of your database] -f schema.sql` from within this directory 
- Run `psql -d [name of your database] -f seed.sql` from within this directory

### ABOUT THIS DATABASE:

Here's what the database looks like:

![erd](./erd.jpg)

There are 18 directors, 31 movies, 6 users, and 44 `user_movies`.

`user_movies` is a join table that represents which users would claim which movies as favorites. Each user can have many favorite movies, and each movie can be favorited by many users.

### PART 1: Basic SQL!

1. Add some movies! Add the title and synopsis of the last 5 movies you've seen that aren't already in the movies table. (If they have directors who aren't in the database, you'll have to add the directors as well!)
    INSERT INTO movies (title, synopsis, director_id)
    VALUES ('My Neighbor Totoro', 'A family makes firends with their neighbors after they move to the country.', 19);

    INSERT INTO directors (name)
    VALUES ('Hayao Miyazaki');

2. As you can see, there is a column for `release_date` in the movies table that hasn't been filled in yet. Add the release date of your 5 favorite movies in the movies table.
    UPDATE movies SET release_date = 1941 WHERE title = 'My Neighbor Totoro';

3. Delete 5 movies from the list you don't like. Like them all? Add 5 movies that are total flops and then delete those suckers üòù.
    DELETE FROM movies WHERE title = 'Annie Hall';

4. Add yourself as a user and create records in `users_movies`  to record your favorites.
    INSERT INTO users (name)
    VALUES ('DJ Louza');

    INSERT INTO users_movies (movie_id, user_id)
    VALUES (3, 7);


### PART 2: Joins!

1. Select all the movies directed by Alex Garland.
    SELECT * FROM 
    movies JOIN directors
    ON directors.id = movies.director_id
    WHERE directors.name = 'Alex Garland';

2. Find the director who directed "There Will Be Blood".
    SELECT * FROM 
    movies JOIN directors
    ON directors.id = movies.director_id
    WHERE movies.title = 'There Will Be Blood';

3. Find all of J's favorites.    
    SELECT * FROM users_movies 
    JOIN movies 
    ON movies.id = users_movies.movie_id
    JOIN users
    ON users_movies.user_id = users.id
    WHERE users.name = 'J';

4. Find everyone who added 'The Shining' as a favorite movie.
    SELECT users.name FROM users_movies 
    JOIN movies 
    ON movies.id = users_movies.movie_id
    JOIN users
    ON users_movies.user_id = users.id
    WHERE movies.title = 'The Shining';

5. List all the movie titles and their corresponding directors.
    SELECT movies.title, directors.name FROM movies
    JOIN directors
    ON movies.director_id = directors.id;

6. Select the movie title and user name for all of the "favorites" represented by the users_movies table.
    SELECT movies.title, users.name FROM users_movies 
    JOIN movies 
    ON movies.id = users_movies.movie_id
    JOIN users
    ON users_movies.user_id = users.id;

### PART 3: Advanced Queries!

These are gonna be hard. Make sure to use your friend google as a resource.

1. List the movies with the number of favorites they have.
    SELECT movies.title, COUNT(users.id) FROM movies
    JOIN users_movies
    ON users_movies.movie_id = movies.id;

2. List the names of directors along with the number of favorites that exist for all of the movies they've made, ordered by number of favorites descending.
3. List the user name, director name and favorite count of all of the user/director combinations (based on the users_movies table).
4. Find the favorite director -- the director whose movies have the most favorites.
